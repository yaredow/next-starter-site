## Next.js

Next.js serves as the robust foundation of this starter template, offering a powerful React framework that simplifies the creation of modern web applications. It provides an elegant solution for both server-side rendering and static site generation, combining the best aspects of traditional and client-side rendering approaches.

### Key benefits of Next.js in this template:

- **Hybrid Rendering** - Choose between static generation and server-side rendering on a per-page basis, optimizing for both performance and SEO
- **Fast Refresh** - Enjoy instant feedback during development with seamless hot module replacement
- **Intuitive Routing** - Navigate between pages with Next.js's file-based routing system
- **API Routes** - Create serverless API endpoints directly within your application
- **Image Optimization** - Automatically optimize images for better performance with the built-in Image component
- **Zero Configuration** - Start developing immediately with sensible defaults that can be customized as needed

The starter template leverages these capabilities to provide a solid foundation for building scalable, production-ready applications.

## tRPC

tRPC allows you to easily build & consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.

This starter template integrates tRPC to enable fully typesafe API development without schemas or code generation. As TypeScript has become the standard in modern web development, tRPC elegantly solves the challenge of maintaining type consistency between client and server.

### Who is tRPC for?

tRPC is for full-stack TypeScript developers. It makes it easy to write endpoints that you can safely use in both the front and backend of your app. Type errors with your API contracts will be caught at build time, reducing the surface for bugs in your application at runtime.

### Features

- **End-to-end Type Safety** - Share types seamlessly between frontend and backend
- **Simplified API Development** - No schema definition or code generation required
- **Improved Developer Experience** - Enjoy autocompletion and type checking across your entire application
- **Reduced Runtime Errors** - Catch potential issues during development rather than in production
- **TypeScript Integration** - Leverages the full power of TypeScript's type system

tRPC helps maintain API contract consistency while significantly reducing boilerplate code.

### Drizzle

[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) is a super fast ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for databases. It helps manage databases, generate TypeScript types from your schema, and run queries in a fully type-safe way.

We use PostgreSQL as our default database, but thanks to Drizzle's flexibility, you can easily switch to MySQL, SQLite or any other supported database by updating a few configuration lines.
