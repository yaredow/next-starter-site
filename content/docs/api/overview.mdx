In building our Next.js starter template, we evaluated three approaches for handling APIs: Next.js API Routes, Hono, and tRPC. Here's a comparison of each, followed by the rationale for choosing tRPC, particularly emphasizing its authenticated prefetching capabilities introduced in version 11.

### Next.js API routes (App Router)

With the introduction of the App Router, Next.js now allows defining API routes inside server components or as server actions. This brings better integration with Reactâ€™s data-fetching patterns. However, there are some drawbacks:

    - Limited Type Safety: You need to manually ensure type consistency between client and server, which can lead to errors.
    - Complex Authentication Handling: Handling authentication requires managing sessions or tokens manually.
    - No Automatic API Layer: Unlike tRPC, you still need to manually structure your API with fetch calls.

While this approach is great for simple APIs within a Next.js app, it lacks the flexibility of a fully structured API framework.

### Hono

Hono is a lightweight web framework optimized for speed and flexibility. Key benefits include:

- Minimal and Fast: Hono is extremely fast and designed for performance.
- Cross-Platform Support: It works on various runtimes like Node.js, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, and Deno.

However, Hono lacks built-in type safety and deep integration with Next.js, requiring additional setup to maintain type consistency between client and server.

### tRPC

tRPC allows for fully type-safe APIs without the need for code generation. Its advantages include:

- End-to-End Type Safety: The client and server share the same types, reducing errors.
- Seamless Next.js Integration: Works natively with Next.js without needing an API layer.
- Authenticated Prefetching in v11:
  - A key reason for choosing tRPC is its ability to prefetch authenticated data in Server Components and SSR.
  - This means protected data can be loaded before rendering, improving performance and user experience.

## tRPC structure

All API procedures and routers are defined inside the trpc/ directory. Each feature module is placed inside the `modules/` directory at the project root, with a server/ folder inside each module that exports its own procedures.

<Files>
  <Folder name="trpc" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="routers">
      <File name="_app.ts" />
    </Folder>
    <File name="client.ts" />
    <File name="server.ts" />
    <File name="init.ts" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

The `trpc/routers/_app.ts` file acts as the central router, importing and combining individual feature routers using createTRPCRouter.

```ts title="_app.ts"
import { userRouter } from "@/modules/users/server/procedures";

import { createTRPCRouter } from "../init";

export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  users: userRouter,
});

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

The API is initialized inside `api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts`, where fetchRequestHandler from `@trpc/server` is used to expose the tRPC router as a Next.js API route at /api/trpc. This setup enables fully type-safe API communication while leveraging Next.js server functions."

```ts title="api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts"
import { fetchRequestHandler } from "@trpc/server/adapters/fetch";
import { appRouter } from "@/trpc/routers/_app";
import { createTRPCContext } from "@/trpc/init";

const handler = (req: Request) =>
  fetchRequestHandler({
    endpoint: "/api/trpc",
    req,
    router: appRouter,
    createContext: createTRPCContext,
  });

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
```
