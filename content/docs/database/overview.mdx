import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

This starter template uses Drizzle as the database. Drizzle is a lightweight, open-source database that provides a simple and efficient way to store and manage data. It's designed to be easy to use and integrate with your Next.js application.

For the database we're leveraging [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), but you could use any other database that Drizzle ORM supports (basically any SQL database e.g. MySQL, SQLite, etc.).

## Setup

To start interacting with the database you first need to ensure that your database instance is up and running.

<Tabs items={["Local development", "Cloud instance"]}>
    <Tab value="Local development">
        ### Local development

        1.  Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
        2.  Run `docker compose up -d` in the root of the project. This will start a local PostgreSQL instance.
        3.  Ensure the environment variables in your `.env` file are configured to point to your local database. The connection string is as following:
            ```
            # The database URL is used to connect to your database.
            DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:3000/postgres"
            ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Cloud instance">
        ### Cloud instance

        1.  Create a PostgreSQL instance in your cloud provider of choice (e.g. Neon, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
        2.  Ensure the environment variables in your `.env` file are configured to point to your cloud database.
        3.  If you're deploying to a serverless environment, make sure your database connection is configured to use connection pooling.

    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Studio

Drizzle ORM also provides you with an interactive UI where you can explore your database and test queres callded Studio

To run the Studio, you can use the following command:

```
pnpx drizzle-kit studio
```

This will start the Studio on [`https://local.drizzle.studio`](https://local.drizzle.studio).
