Defining a schema for your data is a fundamental step in building any new application.

You can find the schema definitions for each table in the `src/db/schema` directory. The schema is structured by entity, with each file representing a separate table.

## Defining schema

The schema is defined using SQL-like utilities from drizzle-orm.

It supports all the SQL features, such as enums, indexes, foreign keys, extensions and more.

<Callout title="Code-first approach">
  This template is using a code-first approach, defining the schema in code and
  generating SQL from it. This allows for full type-safety and a straightforward
  flow for database updates and migrations.
</Callout>

### Example

```ts title="Schema.ts"
export const user = pgTable("user", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  name: text("name").notNull(),
  email: text("email").notNull().unique(),
  emailVerified: boolean("email_verified").notNull(),
  image: text("image"),
  twoFactorEnabled: boolean("two_factor_enabled"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at").notNull(),
  stripeCustomerId: text("stripe_customer_id"),
});
```

We're using a few native SQL utilities here, such as:

- `pgTable`: This function is used to define a PostgreSQL table schema. It takes the table name as the first argument and an object defining the table columns and constraints as the second argument.

- `text`: This function defines a text column in the table schema. It takes the column name as the first argument and can be chained with methods like `.notNull()` and `.unique()` to add constraints.

- `boolean`: This function defines a boolean column in the table schema. It takes the column name as the first argument and can be chained with the `.notNull()` method to add a constraint.

- `timestamp`: This function defines a timestamp column in the table schema, typically used for storing date and time values. It takes the column name as the first argument and can be chained with the `.notNull()` method to add a constraint.

Furthermore, Drizzle allows us to export TypeScript types for the table, which can be reused, for example, in API calls.

Additionally, we can use the Drizzle extension drizzle-zod to generate Zod schemas for the table.

```ts title="Schema.ts"
import { createInsertSchema, createSelectSchema } from "drizzle-zod";

export const userCreateSchema = createSelectSchema(user);
export const userInsertSchema = createInsertSchema(user);
```

Then we can use the generated schemas in the frontend forms to validate the data.
