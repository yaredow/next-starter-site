To get started, insure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)(20.x or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)(Only if you want to use local database)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Project development

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install Dependecies
    <DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="pnpm install" />
    <Card title="Why pnpm?" className="mt-4">
      `pnpm` is used because it's faster and more efficient than `npm` or
      `yarn`. It saves disk space and boosts installation speed by using a
      content-addressable file system to store all packages in a single location
      on your disk. When you install a package, `pnpm` creates hard links to the
      packages in this central store, instead of copying them.

  <Step>
    ### Setup environment variables
    <Card title="Setup .env file" className="mt-4">
      You can duplicate the `.env.example` and `.env.local.example` files and
      rename it to `.env` and `.env.local`. Then, set the variables according to
      your needs.

  </Step>
<Step>
    ### Start database
    <DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="docker compose up -d" />
    <Card title="Why docker?" className="mt-4">
        We use `docker` to run a local database. This is optional, but it's
        recommended if you want to develop locally. If you want to connect to a
        remote database, you can skip this step and configure the connection
        details in the `.env` file.
    </Card>
</Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start development server
    <DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="pnpm run dev" />
    <Card title="Development server" className="mt-4">
      This command starts the development server. You can access the application
      in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
    </Card>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Deploy to production
    <DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="pnpm run build && pnpm run start" />
    <Card title="Production deployment" className="mt-4">
      This command builds the application for production and starts the
      production server.
